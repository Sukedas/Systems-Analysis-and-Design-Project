ðŸ“„ README â€“ Systemic Analysis of the GoDaddy Microbusiness Density Forecasting System

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project presents a systemic analysis of the GoDaddy Microbusiness Density Forecasting competition, focusing on:

The systemâ€™s structure and components.

Sources of complexity and sensitivity.

The role of chaos and randomness in forecasting.

The report is written in LaTeX (IEEEtran format) and enhanced with diagrams extracted from supporting material.

ðŸ›  Methodology

Competition Understanding

Reviewed Kaggleâ€™s GoDaddy Microbusiness Density Forecasting dataset and objectives.

Identified constraints: noisy data, missing predictors, external shocks (pandemics, crises).

Systemic Analysis

Broke down the system into purpose, components, inputs, processes, outputs, and feedback loops.

Classified variables into demographic, economic, institutional, and external.

Complexity & Sensitivity

Evaluated nonlinearities, multicausality, and thresholds.

Noted how small predictor changes (e.g., income, policies) significantly alter forecasts.

Chaos & Randomness

Compared forecasting to chaotic systems (e.g., contrail formation in atmospheric studies).

Discussed randomness from sensor noise, missing data, and nonlinear feedback.

Diagram Integration

Extracted and included diagrams from the provided PDF (diagramas (1).pdf) to illustrate the forecasting workflow and data handling pipeline.

ðŸ“Š Diagrams

Two key diagrams were included:

Systemic Workflow â€“ from raw time series to retraining feedback loops.

Modeling & Uncertainty Zone â€“ highlighting ingestion, preprocessing, training, and monitoring.

Both were added as figures inside the LaTeX document.

ðŸ’» Code & Tools Used

LaTeX with the IEEEtran document class.

Packages: cite, amsmath, amssymb, graphicx, hyperref, enumitem, tikz.

PDF diagrams included via \includegraphics.

Optional diagram editing/replication with TikZ if needed.
