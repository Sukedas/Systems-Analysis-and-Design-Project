# Systems Analysis & Design â€” Course Project 3

Template project scaffold for integrating a machine learning model, creating an end-to-end pipeline, preparing Kaggle submissions, running simulations, and producing a final report.

Structure:
- `src/` - project source code and modules
- `notebooks/` - exploratory and evaluation notebooks
- `scripts/` - helper CLI scripts (train, simulate, submit)
- `models/` - saved model artifacts (gitignored)
- `report/` - report template and assets

See `requirements.txt` for Python dependencies.
